This is a sample article to test our build script. It includes various markdown features to ensure everything works correctly.

## Code Blocks

Here's some JavaScript code:

```javascript
function greetUser(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
  return `Welcome to the site, ${name}`;
}

const user = "Evan";
greetUser(user);
```

And some CSS:

```css
.article {
  max-width: 800px;
  margin: 0 auto;
  padding: 2rem;
}

.article h1 {
  color: #333;
  font-size: 2rem;
}
```

## Lists

Here's an unordered list:

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

And an ordered list:

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

## Links and Emphasis

This is **bold text** and this is *italic text*. Here's a [link to Google](https://google.com).

## Blockquotes

> This is a blockquote. It can span multiple lines and is typically used for quotes or important callouts.

That's all for this sample article!
